Creating a Learning Management System (LMS) with Golang and React sounds like an exciting project! For a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), you'll want to focus on essential features that provide core functionality while keeping the development manageable. Here are some key features to consider:

1. **User Authentication**: Allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. This is crucial for securing your platform and personalizing the user experience.

2. **Course Management**: Enable instructors to create, update, and delete courses. This should include the ability to upload course materials like videos, PDFs, and quizzes.

3. **User Roles**: Differentiate between roles such as students, instructors, and administrators. Each role should have specific permissions and access levels.

4. **Content Delivery**: Implement a system for delivering course content to students. This could be through video streaming, downloadable files, or interactive content.

5. **Progress Tracking**: Allow students to track their progress through courses. This could include features like completion percentages, progress bars, and certificates upon completion.

6. **Quizzes and Assessments**: Provide tools for creating and taking quizzes. This helps in evaluating student understanding and engagement.

7. **Discussion Forums**: Facilitate communication between students and instructors through discussion boards or forums. This encourages interaction and community building.

8. **Notifications**: Implement a notification system to keep users informed about course updates, deadlines, and other important information.

9. **Responsive Design**: Ensure your application is mobile-friendly so users can access it from any device.

10. **Basic Analytics**: Include basic analytics for instructors to track student performance and engagement.

Starting with these features will give you a solid foundation for your LMS. As you gather feedback from users, you can iteratively add more advanced features.

Do you have any specific requirements or ideas in mind for your LMS?
